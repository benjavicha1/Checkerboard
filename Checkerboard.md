1. Reflect on (think about) the work you did for the challenge. How did you do? What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What did you do differently (and possibly better) than what was posted in the solution? What was hard to do?

I think I did well on this assignment since the result is as intended and similar to the given solution. However, there is sometimes unwanted white space at the bottom of window after resizing. The difficult part would be resizing the size of the board.
