1. Reflect on (think about) the work you did for the challenge. How did you do? What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What did you do differently (and possibly better) than what was posted in the solution? What was hard to do?

I think I did well on this assignment since the result is as intended and similar to the given solution. However, there is sometimes unwanted white space at the bottom of window after resizing. The difficult part would be resizing the size of the board.

2. How well did you understand the programming concepts and foundational knowledge needed to complete the challenge?

I've some experienced about OOP concept from OO class many years ago. However, I need to brush up my OO concept again since I hadn't been working with it for awhile. So, I bit of review helps me refamilize with the concept and I even understand some of the concepts I missed more than before.

3. How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly (if any)?

I think my work did meet all the requirements as set out in the challenge since the interface look as intended comparing to solution.

4. How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?
I have two different folder, i.e., anchor and checkboard. I got functions than the solution has. Anyway, the overall implementations are the same.

5. How could you improve going forward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?

I could improve my implementation by revise and get rid of some unneceesary repition of code. I think I understood the overall concept of requirements of the challenge but I needed more time to get more familiar with syntax and concept more. So, I can boost up my confidence level when coding with OOP.
